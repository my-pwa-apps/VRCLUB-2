# 🔦 Lighting Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Lighting Not Working

### Problem
The club appears too dark or the dynamic lighting system (lasers, spotlights, strobes) is not visible or functioning.

### Root Causes Identified
1. All dynamic lights were initialized with `intensity: 0`
2. `switchLightMode()` was not called on initial scene load
3. Ambient lighting was too dim for baseline visibility
4. Light element selectors needed optimization

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Initial Light Activation
**Problem**: Lights stayed at 0 intensity on page load.

**Fix**: Added startup trigger in `setupLightShowSequence()`:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  this.switchLightMode(this.currentLightMode);
}, 1000); // 1-second delay to ensure scene is loaded
```

### 2. Improved Light Selectors
**Problem**: Generic selectors might not find all light elements.

**Fix**: Made selectors more specific:
```javascript
const spotlights = document.querySelectorAll(
  '#spotlight-1 [light], #spotlight-2 [light], #spotlight-3 [light], #spotlight-4 [light], #spotlight-5 [light]'
);
const strobes = document.querySelectorAll(
  '#strobe-1 [light], #strobe-2 [light], #strobe-3 [light], #strobe-4 [light], #strobe-5 [light]'
);
```

### 3. Enhanced Base Lighting
**Problem**: Scene too dark before dynamic lights activate.

**Fix**: Increased ambient and fill lighting:
- Ambient: `0.3` → `0.5` intensity
- Fill light: `0.15` → `0.25` intensity
- Rim lights: `0.4` → `0.6` intensity
- Added back wall accent light

### 4. Debug Logging
**Problem**: No visibility into what's happening with lights.

**Fix**: Added console logging:
```javascript
console.log('Switching to mode:', mode);
console.log('Found elements:', {
  laserCylinders: laserCylinders.length,
  spotlights: spotlights.length,
  strobes: strobes.length,
  ledPanels: ledPanels.length
});
```

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Hard Refresh
```
Ctrl + F5 (Windows/Linux)
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
```

### Step 2: Open Browser Console
Press `F12` or right-click → "Inspect" → "Console" tab

### Step 3: Look for Debug Messages
You should see:
```
Switching to mode: lasers
Found elements: {laserCylinders: 6, spotlights: 5, strobes: 5, ledPanels: 3}
```

### Step 4: Verify Light Behavior
- **T+0s**: Scene loads with ambient lighting (dim purple glow)
- **T+1s**: First light mode activates (lasers in red)
- **T+8s**: Mode switches to spotlights
- **T+16s**: Mode switches to strobes
- **T+24s**: Mode switches to mixed (all lights)
- **Continues cycling...**

## 🎨 Expected Light Behavior

### Mode 1: LASERS (Red → Green → Blue → Magenta → Yellow → Cyan)
- ✅ 6 laser beams visible from ceiling to floor
- ✅ All beams same color
- ✅ Emitters glowing at ceiling
- ✅ Beams rotating slowly
- ✅ Opacity: 0.8, Intensity: 2.0

### Mode 2: SPOTLIGHTS
- ✅ 5 colored spotlights active
- ✅ Lights rotating/sweeping floor
- ✅ Visible cone of light
- ✅ Intensity: 2.5
- ✅ LED panels pulsing (0.8 intensity)

### Mode 3: STROBES
- ✅ 5 white strobe lights
- ✅ Rapid flash pattern
- ✅ Random timing per strobe
- ✅ High intensity bursts (3.5)

### Mode 4: MIXED
- ✅ All lasers active (same color, lower intensity)
- ✅ All spotlights active
- ✅ LED panels glowing
- ✅ Balanced lighting across all systems

## 🎵 Music Reactivity

If music is playing, lights should respond to frequencies:

### Bass (Low Frequencies)
- Laser beam opacity increases
- Ground haze becomes more visible
- Disco ball brightens

### Mids (Melody/Vocals)
- Laser intensity peaks
- Laser beam radius expands (volumetric effect)
- Spotlight intensity increases
- Emitter glow brightens

### Highs (Treble/Percussion)
- Strobe flash triggers
- LED panel brightness pulses
- Dust particles brighten

## 🐛 Still Not Working?

### Check Console for Errors
Look for JavaScript errors in console:
- Red text indicates errors
- Yellow warnings are usually okay

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Cannot read property 'setAttribute' of null"
**Cause**: Scene not fully loaded before lights are accessed.

**Fix**: Increase the timeout delay:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  this.switchLightMode(this.currentLightMode);
}, 2000); // Increase to 2 seconds
```

#### Issue: Found elements shows 0 counts
**Cause**: HTML element IDs or classes don't match selectors.

**Fix**: Verify HTML has:
- `<a-entity id="spotlight-1">` through `spotlight-5`
- `<a-entity id="strobe-1">` through `strobe-5`
- Elements with class `.laser-beam-cylinder`

#### Issue: Lights visible but not music-reactive
**Cause**: Audio analysis not initialized or no music playing.

**Fix**: 
1. Click the music control panel
2. Enter a valid music URL
3. Click again to play
4. Check console for "Audio context created"

#### Issue: Scene is completely black
**Cause**: Ambient lighting too low or shadows blocking all light.

**Fix**: Temporarily boost ambient light:
```html
<a-entity light="type: ambient; color: #ffffff; intensity: 1.0"></a-entity>
```

## 🔍 Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Can you see the DJ booth and stage? (Base lighting)
- [ ] After 1 second, do colored lights appear? (Initial activation)
- [ ] Do lights change every 8 seconds? (Mode cycling)
- [ ] Are there 6 laser beams visible? (Laser system)
- [ ] Are all lasers the same color? (Color synchronization)
- [ ] Do spotlights have visible cones? (Spotlight fixtures)
- [ ] When music plays, do lights pulse? (Music reactivity)
- [ ] Console shows "Switching to mode: X"? (Debug logging)
- [ ] Console shows correct element counts? (Selector working)

## 📊 Expected Console Output

```
Club Environment initialized
Switching to mode: lasers
Found elements: {
  laserCylinders: 6,
  spotlights: 5,
  strobes: 5,
  ledPanels: 3
}

[8 seconds later]
Switching to mode: spotlights
Found elements: {...}

[8 seconds later]
Switching to mode: strobes
Found elements: {...}

[8 seconds later]
Switching to mode: mixed
Found elements: {...}
```

## 🎯 Quick Diagnostic

Run this in the browser console to check light status:

```javascript
// Check if lights exist
console.log('Lasers:', document.querySelectorAll('.laser-beam-cylinder').length);
console.log('Spotlights:', document.querySelectorAll('#spotlight-1, #spotlight-2, #spotlight-3, #spotlight-4, #spotlight-5').length);
console.log('Strobes:', document.querySelectorAll('#strobe-1, #strobe-2, #strobe-3, #strobe-4, #strobe-5').length);

// Check ambient light
const ambient = document.querySelector('[light][type="ambient"]');
console.log('Ambient light:', ambient ? ambient.getAttribute('light') : 'NOT FOUND');

// Manually activate lasers
setTimeout(() => {
  document.querySelectorAll('.laser-beam-cylinder').forEach(l => {
    l.setAttribute('material', 'opacity', 0.8);
    l.setAttribute('material', 'emissiveIntensity', 2);
  });
  console.log('Lasers manually activated!');
}, 1000);
```

## 💡 Performance Tips

If lights are working but performance is poor:

1. **Reduce shadow quality**: Comment out shadow-related attributes
2. **Lower light distances**: Reduce `distance` values in lights
3. **Simplify materials**: Lower `metalness` and `roughness` complexity
4. **Reduce fog density**: Increase fog `far` value
5. **Disable particles**: Comment out dust particle animations

## 📞 Support Checklist

If you need to report an issue, include:
1. Browser console output (copy all text)
2. Browser name and version
3. VR headset type (if applicable)
4. Screenshot of the scene
5. Whether lights appear at all or just don't react
6. What you see in the console debug logs

const colors = ['#ff0000', '#00ff00', '#0000ff', '#ff00ff', '#ffff00', '#00ffff'];
```

### Adjust Light Show Timing
Edit `js/club-environment.js`:
```javascript
setInterval(() => {
  // ...
}, 8000); // Change 8000 to desired milliseconds
```

### Modify Styles
Edit `css/styles.css` to change UI appearance

### Add New Rooms
Edit `index.html` and add new `<a-entity>` sections

## 📱 Testing

### Desktop Browser
- ✅ Chrome/Edge with mouse and WASD
- ✅ Firefox with mouse and WASD
- Look around: Mouse
- Move: WASD keys
- Interact: Click

### Quest 3S
1. Connect to same network as development server
2. Open Meta Quest Browser
3. Navigate to `http://YOUR_IP:8000`
4. Click "Enter VR"
5. Use controllers and movement

## 🔧 Technologies

- **A-Frame 1.5.0** - WebXR framework
- **A-Frame Extras** - Movement controls
- **Networked-A-Frame** - Multiplayer
- **Socket.io** - Real-time communication
- **Web Audio API** - Music analysis

## 📊 Performance Tips

- Lights automatically switch modes to reduce GPU load
- Fog limits render distance
- Materials optimized (metalness/roughness)
- Geometry kept simple (boxes, cylinders, planes)

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Music Won't Play
- ✅ Check CORS on audio source
- ✅ Use direct MP3 URLs when possible
- ✅ For YouTube, use embed format

### Lights Not Reactive
- ✅ Music must be playing
- ✅ Check browser console
- ✅ Refresh if needed

### Can't Connect in VR
- ✅ Use HTTPS in production
- ✅ Check firewall settings
- ✅ Ensure same network

## 📦 Deployment

### GitHub Pages
1. Push to GitHub
2. Settings → Pages
3. Select branch
4. Access at `https://username.github.io/repo`

### Vercel
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

### Netlify
1. Drag and drop folder to Netlify
2. Or connect GitHub repo
3. Auto-deploy on push

## 🎉 Next Steps

- ✅ Test locally with `npm start` or server scripts
- ✅ Try adding music at DJ booth
- ✅ Invite friends to join multiplayer
- ✅ Deploy to production with HTTPS
- ✅ Customize colors and timing
- ✅ Add more rooms or features

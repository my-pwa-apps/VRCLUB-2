# Bug Fixes Applied - October 3, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Floating Speakers Removed
**Problem:** Old simple speaker setup parts were floating in the air due to duplicate `createPASpeakers()` and `createPAStack()` methods.

**Root Cause:** 
- Three duplicate `createPASpeakers()` methods existed (lines 982, 1339, 1872)
- Two duplicate `createPAStack()` methods (lines 1003, 1371, 1907)
- Second `createBarArea()` method was corrupted with speaker code inside it

**Solution:**
- Kept only the FIRST simple `createPASpeakers()` method (line 982)
- Removed duplicate methods at lines 1339-1535 and 1872-1935
- Cleaned up corrupted `createBarArea()` method
- Removed embedded speaker code fragments

**Result:** Only one clean PA speaker system remains, positioned correctly at x=±10, z=-15

### 2. ✅ In-VR Audio Stream Input
**Problem:** Audio stream URL input used browser `prompt()` dialog, which forced users to switch out of the VR/immersive experience.

**Solution:**
- Created `showAudioStreamInputUI()` method
- Displays styled HTML overlay within the experience
- Features:
  - Centered input panel with green theme
  - Text input field for URL
  - PLAY and CANCEL buttons
  - Enter key to submit
  - Escape key to close
  - Auto-focus on input field
  - Demo stream option (leave empty)
- Added `startAudioStream(url)` method to handle playback
- Added `showErrorMessage(message)` for user-friendly error display

**Result:** Users can now enter audio stream URLs without leaving the immersive experience

### 3. ✅ Color Change Updates Reflections
**Problem:** When changing spotlight colors via the VJ "NEXT COLOR" button, the light's diffuse color changed but the specular component (reflections) did not update, causing mismatched colors on reflective surfaces.

**Solution:**
Updated the color change handler in `setupVJControlInteraction()` to:
- Set `spot.light.diffuse = this.currentSpotColor`
- **Added** `spot.light.specular = this.currentSpotColor` (NEW!)
- Update fixture lens emissive colors immediately
- Update light source emissive colors immediately
- Access truss-mounted lights array for fixture updates

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Update ALL light colors immediately (diffuse AND specular for reflections)
if (this.spotlights) {
    this.spotlights.forEach((spot, i) => {
        spot.light.diffuse = this.currentSpotColor;
        spot.light.specular = this.currentSpotColor; // ADD SPECULAR for reflections
        spot.color = this.currentSpotColor;
        
        // Update fixture lens and light source colors
        if (this.trussLights && this.trussLights[i]) {
            const trussLight = this.trussLights[i];
            if (trussLight.lensMat && this.lightsActive) {
                trussLight.lensMat.emissiveColor = this.currentSpotColor.scale(5.0);
            }
            if (trussLight.sourceMat && this.lightsActive) {
                trussLight.sourceMat.emissiveColor = this.currentSpotColor.scale(8.0);
            }
        }
    });
}
```

**Result:** Spotlight colors now update completely including reflections on floor, walls, and other reflective surfaces

## Notes

### Performance Impact
- **Positive:** Removing 500+ lines of duplicate code should improve loading time
- **Neutral:** In-VR UI is HTML overlay, minimal performance impact
- **Neutral:** Specular update is one extra line per spotlight (6 lights total)

### Browser Compatibility
- In-VR UI requires modern browser with ES6 support
- All major browsers supported (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- VR headset Link/Air Link continues to work normally

### Future Improvements
- Could add virtual keyboard for VR-only input (no desktop keyboard)
- Could add preset URL buttons for popular streams
- Could save last used URL to localStorage
- Could add volume controls to in-VR UI

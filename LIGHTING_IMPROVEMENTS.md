# VR Club Lighting System Improvements

## Overview
Major updates to the lighting and laser systems for enhanced realism and professional club atmosphere.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Alternating Lights/Lasers Pattern ✅
**Problem:** Both spotlights and lasers were always on simultaneously, unrealistic for clubs.

**Solution:**
- Added `lightsActive` and `lasersActive` boolean flags
- Implemented automatic alternation every 15-30 seconds
- Only one system active at a time, creating dynamic atmosphere
- Smooth transitions with intensity fade to zero

**Code:**
```javascript
// Alternate between lights and lasers (every 15-30 seconds)
if (time - this.lightModeSwitchTime > (15 + Math.random() * 15)) {
    this.lightsActive = !this.lightsActive;
    this.lasersActive = !this.lasersActive;
    this.lightModeSwitchTime = time;
}
```

### 2. Reduced Laser Count (6 → 3) ✅
**Problem:** 6 laser fixtures looked overcrowded and unrealistic.

**Solution:**
- Reduced from 6 to 3 laser fixtures
- Strategic positioning: left (-6), center (0), right (6)
- Each fixture at z=-10, y=7.55 (properly hanging from truss)

### 3. Diverse Laser Types ✅
**Problem:** All lasers were identical single beams.

**Solution:** Implemented 3 different laser types:

#### **Single Beam Laser** (Right position)
- One focused beam
- Smooth rotation and tilt movement
- Perfect for highlighting specific areas

#### **Spread Laser** (Left position)
- 3 beams fanning out
- Creates wider coverage
- Beams spread ±0.4 radians

#### **Multi-Beam Laser** (Center position)
- 5 beams rotating in circular pattern
- Creates spectacular light show effect
- Each beam rotates independently in circle formation

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const laserPositions = [
    { x: -6, z: -10, trussY: 7.55, type: 'spread' },   // Spread laser
    { x: 0, z: -10, trussY: 7.55, type: 'multi' },     // Multi-beam
    { x: 6, z: -10, trussY: 7.55, type: 'single' }     // Single beam
];
```

### 4. Proper Truss Mounting ✅
**Problem:** Lasers appeared to float near truss without attachment.

**Solution:**
- Added mounting clamp for each laser fixture
- Clamp positioned above housing at trussY + 0.25
- Metallic PBR material for realistic metal clamp
- Housing positioned at trussY = 7.55 (hanging UNDER truss)

**Dimensions:**
- Housing: 0.25m × 0.2m × 0.35m
- Clamp: 0.3m × 0.15m × 0.3m
- Beam origin: 0.1m below housing center

### 5. Enhanced Smoke Effects ✅
**Problem:** Smoke was barely visible, single source, not immersive.

**Solution:**
- Increased from 1 to 5 smoke machines
- Strategic placement covering dance floor:
  - Front left (-8, -8)
  - Front right (8, -8)
  - Back left (-8, -16)
  - Back right (8, -16)
  - DJ booth (0, -20)

**Improvements:**
- Particle count: 800 → 1200 per system
- Emit rate: 50 → 80 particles/sec
- Size range: 2-6m → 3-10m
- Opacity: 0.1-0.05 → 0.3-0.2 (3x more visible)
- Lifetime: 3-8s → 5-12s (longer lasting)
- Added noise/turbulence for realistic swirling
- Better color (more blue/purple tint)

### 6. Fixed LED Wall Visibility ✅
**Problem:** LED wall not visible behind DJ booth.

**Solution:**
- Moved from z=-26.5 to z=-27 (further back)
- Raised from y=1 to y=2 (higher base position)
- Now clearly visible above and behind DJ booth
- Better viewing angle from dance floor

## Technical Details

### Laser Beam System Architecture
```javascript
laser = {
    beams: [                    // Array of beam objects
        { mesh, material, beamIndex }
    ],
    lights: [                   // SpotLights for illumination
        SpotLight objects
    ],
    housing: Mesh,              // Visual housing
    clamp: Mesh,                // Mounting bracket
    housingMat: Material,       // Shared housing material
    type: 'single'|'spread'|'multi',
    rotation: 0,                // Current rotation angle
    tiltPhase: 0,              // Tilt animation phase
    originPos: Vector3         // Beam start position
}
```

### Beam Type Implementations

**Single Beam:**
```javascript
const tilt = Math.PI / 6 + Math.sin(laser.tiltPhase) * 0.3;
direction = new Vector3(
    Math.sin(rotation) * Math.sin(tilt),
    -Math.cos(tilt),
    Math.cos(rotation) * Math.sin(tilt)
);
```

**Spread Beam:**
```javascript
const spreadAngle = (beamIndex - 1) * 0.4;  // -0.4, 0, 0.4
const tilt = Math.PI / 6 + Math.sin(tiltPhase) * 0.2;
direction = new Vector3(
    Math.sin(rotation + spreadAngle) * Math.sin(tilt),
    -Math.cos(tilt),
    Math.cos(rotation + spreadAngle) * Math.sin(tilt)
);
```

**Multi Beam:**
```javascript
const baseAngle = (beamIndex / 5) * Math.PI * 2;
const rotatingAngle = baseAngle + rotation * 2;
const tilt = Math.PI / 5;
direction = new Vector3(
    Math.sin(rotatingAngle) * Math.sin(tilt),
    -Math.cos(tilt),
    Math.cos(rotatingAngle) * Math.sin(tilt)
);
```

## Performance Impact

### Before:
- 6 single laser beams = 6 meshes, 6 lights
- 1 smoke system with 800 particles
- Constant light/laser activity

### After:
- 3 laser fixtures = 9 beams total (3+5+1), 9 lights
- 5 smoke systems with 6000 total particles
- Alternating activity (only one system at a time)

**Net Performance:** Similar or slightly better due to alternating systems and proper culling.

## Visual Improvements
